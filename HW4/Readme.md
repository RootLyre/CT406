This is the program and the files associated with the 2 tutorials for CS 406 HW 4- Razor.
In these tutorials, we use the Razor Pages and files (.cshtml and .cshtml.cs files) to create and update the given website and pages to create a Movies database with a search, add, edit, and delete features. 

We split the cshtml and cs files to focus their aspects on the 2 different coding languages, C# and CSHTML. CSHTML focuses more on the layout and actions of the webpages and C# focuses on the data variables and the methods accessible to them.

The phrase "Everything old is new again" pertains to Razor Views and ASP.NET development because views remain passive as they were originally intended to be. The controllers take in user input and manipulate the models and views based on the capabilities and coding of the program and website.
