HW1 - .Net Core Project

Will have 4 uploads total which will be code examples from the book: Echo, Environments, FileServer, MiniWeb, and 2 programs from websites provided

The 2 tuturials from the website were to create a Microsoft Azure ASP.NET Core Webapp using Visual Studio at first, and later to create a Microsoft Azure ASP.NET Core Webapp using command line tools.

The latter tutorial had no code to be saved because it was done from the builtin Azure CLI as well as Git (and then asked during the tutorial to delete what we had accomplished). The URL created from this tutorial was b''://aamorrison@b''/tutorialApp249491438.git and the web app was on tutorialapp249491438.azurewebsites.net

Between the two tutorials, creating the app from Visual Studio was much more intuitive and honestly made more sense than the roundabout interactivity between Azure CLI and Git. I'm hoping that the free Azure trial we used for this won't be used on later assignments because I really don't want to have to pay for continued service.
