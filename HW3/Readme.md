This is the Readme.md for CT406 HW3: MVC & Views.

The purpose of this code is to see and learn the difference between dynamic and strongly typed views (or stongly as they kept spelling it in the tutorial). 
The important files are the HomeController edits in HomeController.cs and the 2 newly created view files IndexNotStronglyTyped.cshtml and StronglyTypedIndex.cshtml
