This is the Readme.md for CT406 HW3: MVC & Views.

The purpose of this code is to see and learn the difference between dynamic and strongly typed views (or stongly as they kept spelling it in the tutorial). A Dynamic view has no knowledge of the properties of the object, so it cannot suggest or autofill in a property when writing code. A Strongly typed view however can finish and list off all the properties associated with the object being coded in.


The important files are the HomeController edits in HomeController.cs and the 2 newly created view files IndexNotStronglyTyped.cshtml and StronglyTypedIndex.cshtml
