This is the Final Project for CT 406 to Build my own Resume with .Net Core

Professor thank you for the extension to get this website done. 
It consists of a main page which then has 3 separate razor pages: "About Me" which has a picture of myself and a few things about me, "Jobs" which was going to include my database of jobs but there were quite a few bugs trying to get that working, and "Resume" which lists my current resume as is.
