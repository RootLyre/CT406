This is the Final Project for CT 406 to Build my own Resume with .Net Core

Professor thank you for the extension to get this website done. So far, December has been project after project with a 30+ page paper, 
a videogame demo, a presentation, as well as another final that was replaced with a massive code project. 
I truly am grateful for the extension.
Even though you gave me until Dec 19th, I believe I can get it done before then.
